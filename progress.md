## Current Build Issues

**CMake Configuration Issues:**
- ❌ Target ordering problem in CMakeLists.txt - `voice_transcription_backend` target referenced before it's defined
- ❌ Incorrect placement of `target_compile_definitions` and other target-specific commands
- ❌ Build fails due to improper target definition order

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

#### Fix CMake Build Configuration:
- Reorder CMakeLists.txt to define the `voice_transcription_backend` target before referencing it
- Move all target-specific commands (`target_link_libraries`, `target_compile_definitions`) after target definition
- Ensure proper dependency ordering in the build process
- Create verification tests for successful build outcomes

#### Implement Basic C++/Python Bridge:
- Create a simple "hello world" test function to verify pybind11 integration
- Test basic data type conversions between C++ and Python
- Implement proper error handling for cross-language calls
- Unit test each bound function individually before integration

#### Core Audio Pipeline Development:
- Complete PortAudio device enumeration and selection
- Implement and test audio streaming with proper buffer management
- Integrate WebRTC VAD with test cases for speech/non-speech detection
- Connect basic Vosk functionality with a small test model
- Implement simple text output methods (keypresses or clipboard)

#### Build End-to-End Minimal Workflow:
- Connect all components into a single processing pipeline
- Implement simple circular buffer for audio samples
- Create thread-safe queues for cross-thread communication
- Build state management for transcription toggling
- Add logging throughout the pipeline for debugging

### Medium-Term Goals

#### Complete User Interface Integration:
- Connect C++ backend components to Python GUI
- Implement device selection dropdown with proper feedback
- Create audio level visualization for input monitoring
- Add transcription status indicators
- Implement user-friendly error notifications

#### Improve Robustness and Error Handling:
- Implement comprehensive error recovery strategies
- Add graceful degradation for component failures
- Create user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Implement automatic recovery for transient errors

### Long-Term Goals

#### Performance and Quality Improvements:
- Implement custom acoustic models for improved accuracy
- Add domain-specific language models for specialized vocabulary
- Implement adaptive noise cancellation
- Create background training capability for personalized models

#### Feature Enhancements:
- Add support for speaker diarization (identifying different speakers)
- Implement automatic punctuation
- Add translation capabilities
- Create plugin system for application-specific commands
