## Resolved Blockers

**CMake configuration issues:**
- ✅ Fixed target ordering problem in CMakeLists.txt - `voice_transcription_backend` target is now properly defined before being referenced
- ✅ Corrected placement of `target_compile_definitions` and other target-specific commands
- ✅ Build successfully produces the Python module

**PortAudio library linking issue:**
- ✅ Fixed corrupt/incompatible PortAudio library files
- ✅ Implemented proper detection and setup of PortAudio library
- ✅ Added directory-independent absolute path handling for PortAudio files
- ✅ Created comprehensive search with fallback for locating built libraries

**Vosk implementation:**
- ✅ Replaced mock implementation with real Vosk functionality
- ✅ Added proper JSON parsing with RapidJSON
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling in transcription engine

**Python dependency management:**
- ✅ Added categorization of dependencies (essential vs. optional)
- ✅ Implemented layered fallback for dependency installation
- ✅ Added verification steps to confirm successful installations
