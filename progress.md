## Implementation Details to Verify

The following implementation details should be verified during integration and testing:

### Performance and Stability
- ⚠️ Memory ownership in `transcribe_with_noise_filtering` - Ensure the audio chunk copying doesn't lead to unnecessary allocations in performance-critical paths
- ⚠️ Circular buffer calculation - Verify the buffer overflow handling works correctly when `buffer_pos < read_pos`
- ⚠️ Thread safety of `ErrorRecoveryManager` - Ensure all callbacks and signal emissions from background threads are thread-safe

### Resource Management
- ⚠️ AudioLevelMonitor reference safety - Ensure that when audio streams are destroyed, the monitor is properly stopped to prevent accessing invalid memory
- ⚠️ Proper cleanup of resources on application exit - Verify all threads are properly joined and resources released

### User Interface
- ⚠️ Audio level meter layout scaling - Ensure the UI doesn't break on different screen sizes and DPI settings
- ⚠️ Add minimum/maximum size constraints for components to ensure consistent visual appearance

### Build Configuration
- ⚠️ CMake compile definition placement - Ensure `target_compile_definitions(voice_transcription_backend PRIVATE HAS_CONDITION_VARIABLE=1)` is placed after target definition but before linking commands
