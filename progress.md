## Previous Blockers (Resolved)

**PortAudio library linking issue:**
- [x] ✅ Fixed corrupt/incompatible PortAudio library files
- [x] ✅ Implemented proper detection and setup of PortAudio library

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

#### Resolve PortAudio linking issue:
- Option 1: Replace with fresh library
- Option 2: Use dynamic loading approach
- Option 3: Use mock implementation for initial development

#### Complete remaining C++ implementation:
- Finish implementation of Vosk transcription engine
- Implement proper error handling throughout
- Add resource management and cleanup

#### Implement Python GUI:
- Create main window UI
- Implement device selection dialog
- Create shortcut capture UI
- Add status indicators

### Medium-Term Goals

#### Implement full test suite:
- Unit tests for all C++ components
- Python GUI tests
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality

#### Optimize performance:
- Measure and optimize memory usage
- Profile and improve transcription latency
- Enhance thread management

#### Enhance user experience:
- Add visual feedback for transcription
- Improve error reporting
- Add configuration options
