## Resolved Blockers

### CMake configuration issues
- ✅ Fixed target ordering problem in CMakeLists.txt - `voice_transcription_backend` target is now properly defined before being referenced
- ✅ Corrected placement of `target_compile_definitions` and other target-specific commands
- ✅ Build successfully produces the Python module

### PortAudio library linking issue
- ✅ Fixed corrupt/incompatible PortAudio library files
- ✅ Implemented proper detection and setup of PortAudio library
- ✅ Added directory-independent absolute path handling for PortAudio files
- ✅ Created comprehensive search with fallback for locating built libraries

### Vosk implementation
- ✅ Replaced mock implementation with real Vosk functionality
- ✅ Added proper JSON parsing with RapidJSON
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling in transcription engine

### Python dependency management
- ✅ Added categorization of dependencies (essential vs. optional)
- ✅ Implemented layered fallback for dependency installation
- ✅ Added verification steps to confirm successful installations

## Current Blockers

### Audio streaming stability
- ⚠️ Audio streaming can sometimes become unstable after long usage periods
- ⚠️ Need to address memory management in audio buffer
- **Possible solutions:**
  - Implement circular buffer with proper overflow handling
  - Add better resource cleanup on stream stop/restart
  - Monitor memory usage and implement automatic recovery

### Vosk model loading performance
- ⚠️ Initial Vosk model loading takes too long on slower systems
- **Possible solutions:**
  - Add progress indicator during model loading
  - Implement background loading with fallback to smaller model
  - Add model caching mechanism
